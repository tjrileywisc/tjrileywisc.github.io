Blowing off the dust of my python knowledge. After using most C++ for the past 4+ years, the language feels more 'loose' than I am used to. I feel like I need
to be adding types everywhere (which I gather now is a preferred practice!)

Also it feels a little like Groundhog's Day where I'm having to revisit old ground.
