My meeting transcription project was always going to have a web interface. I'm not trying for anything fancy here - for now I want to show the video,
a list of videos that can be loaded, and when a video is showing, show the transcription with the identified speaker. Eventually I'll try for some
sort of search and maybe an edit function when speakers are wrong.

My webdev skills needed some brushing up. I'm also not trying to be a web developer, though I did play with React a bit a few years back and thought it would be
worth getting back into it again. I managed to throw together something quick with the help of ChatGPT to speed things along (I think it's about a 50-50 effort, my js is slow)
and achieved most of my goals above. It's definitely rough around the edges (the video player component is right above the subtitle component and things jitter, maybe a css thing).

Anyway, I put up a new repo and pushed up my [current version](https://github.com/tjrileywisc/waltham-comments-page/commit/9cd7540434488bec5979290b288a57b03270011d).
