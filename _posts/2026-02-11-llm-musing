Thinking about how LLM models that generate code will affect software engineers. I could see more code generated by senior level engineers leading to higher quality outputs than we have at the moment (inasmuch as more recently generated code can be weighted as more desirable). Is it enough of a threat that experienced software engineers might need to start worrying about job security? Who knows - but this certainly isn't helping out the junior engineer market.

At some point though I could see things flipping and companies might decide that LLM models trained on senior engineers' output plus a cheaper junior engineer makes sense,
and maybe this turns into a cyclical hiring cycle.
