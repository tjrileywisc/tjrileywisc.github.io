## Selected Projects

### Speaker diarization and transcription of Waltham City Council meetings
**Tools:** python, pytorch, OpenAI Whisper, pyannote  
Enhance government transparency by keeping track of who said what, when. No more looking through old videos without
subtitles in an attempt to get an idea of what your city councillor really thinks.

### Waltham GIS
**Tools:** GIS, python, marimo, jupyter, postgres, pandas
A lot of our local economy depends on development rules. Using GIS, I want to explore the effects of Waltham's zoning code
on our housing market to try to put real numbers around the decisions our city government is making.
