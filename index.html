I'm planning on taking a candlestick phone and converting it to be used with an Android OS phone so that the candlestick
phone can both receive and send calls via bluetooth.

This project touches a lot of areas that I'm not familiar with:
- Bluetooth (used for connections)
- Java (Android app will be programmed in Java)
