        Got some time to work on the app this evening. Moved the notification code out of the onCreate method of the main activity and into the
        background service instead (it feels more correct there). The service appears to be starting correctly but I am now trying to change the
        notification text so that it changes when a call comes in (I think that was working at one point) and also the behavior will be different

        I was finally able to make some small progress on the app after distractions of machine learning and moving the past couple of weeks.</br>

        Now the app has a running service and has a notification that changes when an incoming phone call is received. Still need to do some updates to
        watch the actual current call state and update the notification. When a call comes in, it should allow the user to start a specific activity that
        just has two big buttons; take the call on the phone you are holding, or send it to the phone. That activity launches, but I'll need to send
        something via bluetooth when the second button is pressed to pass the call.

        An apparent setback...

        I had intended to implement an android OS service to run in the background and listen for any phone call coming to a phone paired with the
        candlestick phone. An implicit intent would then have to be passed to the service to broadcast the change in phone state, but according to what I see
        on Google's developer pages this will result in an exception (since it's not possible to specify which background service should take an intent). I 
        guess I can see why this is the case. I suppose that having the candlestick handler application show up as an option to take the call intent (if
        indeed this is possible) to pass to the candlestick via bluetooth would not be the most onerous requirement to ever be put on the end user
        (it would just be one extra button after all...)

        The bonus being that I don't have to worry about learning how services work, on top of learning how to program in java and manage
        android app development already. Maybe another project.

        This block of xml in my app's android manifest is preventing me from making calls when my app is installed. 
        I assume its intercepting all outgoing call requests via the intent. I'll need to comment it out while I work on other parts.

        <pre>
                    &lt;receiver android:name="OutgoingCallHandler"&gt;
                        &lt;intent-filter&gt;
                            &lt;action android:name="android.intent.action.NEW_OUTGOING_CALL" &gt;
                            &lt;category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" &gt;
                        &lt;intent-filter&gt;
                    &lt;receiver&gt;
                    
        </pre>

        <p>
        EDIT: found the problem was the NEW_OUTGOING_CALL part of the intent, removed that. It's obvious to me know what was happening;
        whenever I had the app on the device it would listen for an attempt to make an outgoing call and take over.
        </p>

        Found some very helpful code at http://www.mkyong.com/android/how-to-make-a-phone-call-in-android/ that allows me to call
        a specific phone number from the app, skipping the OS dialer (I won't need it for this project since I'll eventually be using
        the hardware rotary dial on the candlestick phone). Now the code is in my bluetooth loop so it won't allow the call 
        until it finds a device called 'Candlestick' among visible paired bluetooth devices.

        I'm planning on taking a candlestick phone and converting it to be used with an Android OS phone so that the candlestick
        phone can both receive and send calls via bluetooth. I've seen other projects but it looks like they just shoved a 
        cellphone into the other device, which isn't very elegant in my opinion.

        This project touches a lot of areas that I'm not familiar with:
        - Bluetooth (used for connections)
        - Java (Android app will be programmed in Java)
        - Telephony (not a huge personal interest of mine, just needed for this project)
        - Project blogging in general (in the hopes that it will keep me on task)
        - Git and GitHub (I need more practice with source control)
        - Hardware projects
        - 3D printing (this should be minor hopefully as there's only one part that needs to be replaced)
        - Speakers/microphones
        </p>

        <p>
        I expect the project to proceed in phases:
        1) Simple message transferred from phone to other device via bluetooth
        2) Implementation of a Android OS service to monitor incoming calls, with broadcast of this information to device as above
        3) Allow this external device to send data via bluetooth to app
        4) Data sent from device should be able to trigger a phone call on the Android device
        (this is the real meat of the project)
        5) Phone audio transferred to device
        6) Device should be able to send voice data to phone (and quickly) so that receiver can hear
        (hardware phase)
        7) Put the device into the candlestick body and make sure it can be independent

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
