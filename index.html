This block of xml in my app's android manifest is preventing me from making calls when my app is installed. 
I assume its intercepting all outgoing call requests via the intent. I'll need to comment it out while I work on other parts.

            <receiver android:name="OutgoingCallHandler">
                <intent-filter>
                    <action android:name="android.intent.action.NEW_OUTGOING_CALL" />
                    <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
                </intent-filter>
            </receiver>

I'm planning on taking a candlestick phone and converting it to be used with an Android OS phone so that the candlestick
phone can both receive and send calls via bluetooth. I've seen other projects but it looks like they just shoved a 
cellphone into the other device, which isn't very elegant in my opinion.

This project touches a lot of areas that I'm not familiar with:
- Bluetooth (used for connections)
- Java (Android app will be programmed in Java)
- Telephony (not a huge personal interest of mine, just needed for this project)
- Project blogging in general (in the hopes that it will keep me on task)
- Git and GitHub (I need more practice with source control)
- Hardware projects
- 3D printing (this should be minor hopefully as there's only one part that needs to be replaced)
- Speakers/microphones
</p>

<p>
I expect the project to proceed in phases:
1) Simple message transferred from phone to other device via bluetooth
2) Implementation of a Android OS service to monitor incoming calls, with broadcast of this information to device as above
3) Allow this external device to send data via bluetooth to app
4) Data sent from device should be able to trigger a phone call on the Android device
(this is the real meat of the project)
5) Phone audio transferred to device
6) Device should be able to send voice data to phone (and quickly) so that receiver can hear
(hardware phase)
7) Put the device into the candlestick body and make sure it can be independent
